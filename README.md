This project is the implementation of an online store divided into roles (user, admin, owner). 

The user can visit the product catalog, add products to their cart, edit their data and write to the site owner (under development). 
The administrator can do everything the same as the user and can additionally add, edit and delete his products, receive orders from customers and change the status of the order. 
The owner has additional access to appoint and dismiss administrators, add, edit and delete product categories, and receive letters from users (in development). 

The project was implemented in Java using the Spring framework. Thymeleaf was used as a template engine.


To start using the project, you need to create a database and enter its data in aplication.properties.
